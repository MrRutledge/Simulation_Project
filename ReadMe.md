### Interim Report

#### Introduction:

Simulation modelling plays a big role in each and everyone's life, most of us are technologically connected in one way or other, we fly in aeroplanes, we pay visits to coffee or local shops, supermarkets etc.

Experts in the places mentioned above are likely to have made use of simulation modelling at some stage, the aviation industry stands out for its use of simulation to simulate different scenarios, conditions in a system and study them to see how they would compare in the real world. _Simulation,_ therefore, is defined as duplicating or imitating characteristics of a real-life system, this could be done with mathematical models, computers or even by hand.

 Simulation modelling involves carrying out statistical experiments and interpreting the output with statistical tests.

There are two types of simulation models;

Continuous model: This type of simulation deals with system whose behavior changes with time. Discrete model: deals with systems whose behavior changes that take place at specific discrete points in time. The later type will be the focus of the investigation with the aid of queuing theory.

I started my investigation with collecting data for the single server which I need to analyze and use the results from my distribution fitting investigation to generate random numbers for the two-server simulation. The reason for this is to get data that is as close to my chosen place of investigation rather than generating random data. By knowing how the data for single server is distributed I can generate random numbers following the results from the single-server calculations....
